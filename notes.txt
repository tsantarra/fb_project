Goals:
    - Switch between video feeds in real time according to streamed live data
        + Calculate features in real time for the following data sources
            * Video
                - Faces
                - Movement
                - Group dynamics?
            * Audio
                - Single source without orientation?
                - Single source with orientation (Kinect)
                - Multiple sources
            * Supplementary info
                - Roster of participants
                - Presentation surfaces (tv, screen, whiteboard, table)
        + Tie in transition styles from cinematography
            * HMM? Parameters:
                - Prior over shots (can fix to uniform or bias by hand)
                - Probability of event (emission) given a shot (the target active shot) [Not sure this fits our project]
                - Probability of shot given previous shot


What about an ensemble predictor?
