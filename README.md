##TODO 

Continue refactoring Michael's code to fit the eventual abstract framework of the ensemble system.

* Reduce repetitive code
    
* Port to Python 3.X (which OpenCV supports ala http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#opencv )
    
* Attempt to figure out if slow audio reading is a fact or a symptom of mistake
