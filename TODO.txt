Outline of system architecture:
    Data is input via sources (either streams or static files)
    Sources are fed to feature evaluators, which return weights on what each thinks is important
    The main level system aggregates weights and selects a stream as the primary data source

TODO
    Synchronization
        - in live mode (and possibly in file mode too), dragging windows causes desync
        - audio and video files do not line up in file mode. Video lags audio.
            - cough at 1:32 on Closeup2
            - output cough at
                - 1:32 audio
                - 1:46 video
            - file fps = 25

            - found problem: queue.put blocks by default
                - when disabled, video gets ahead of audio now

Halting:
    - current halt criteria is specified as main process window key entry (not output pane, which is separate)
    - need to determine how to appropriately kill subprocess and release devices

Short-term goals:
    - calibration of audio (so sensitive mics don't dominate)

Technical info:
    - audio sample rates: 44100 16000
    - dtypes float32 Int16

Distortion problem:
    - sample rate must be agreed upon by input and output devices
