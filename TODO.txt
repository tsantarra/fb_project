Tie sources together (audio + video)
Output recording and display
Audio switching feature

Continue refactoring Michael's code to fit the eventual abstract framework of the ensemble system.
    - Reduce repetitive code
    - Attempt to figure out if slow audio reading is a fact or a symptom of mistake
    - Utilize logging module for recording messages and debugging


Outline of system architecture:
    Data is input via sources (either streams or static files, both of which can be treated as generators)
    Sources are fed to feature evaluators, which return weights on what each thinks is important
    The main level system aggregates weights and selects a stream as the primary data source
