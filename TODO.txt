Outline of system architecture:
    Data is input via sources (either streams or static files)
    Sources are fed to feature evaluators, which return weights on what each thinks is important
    The main level system aggregates weights and selects a stream as the primary data source

===================================================================================


TODO
    - clean up files
    - complete documentation

Halting:
    - current halt criteria is specified as main process window key entry (not output pane, which is separate)
    - need to determine how to appropriately kill subprocess and release devices

Short-term goals:
    - calibration of audio (so sensitive mics don't dominate)

Technical info:
    - audio sample rates: 44100 16000
    - dtypes float32 Int16
    - sample rate must be agreed upon by input and output devices; otherwise, distortion occurs
